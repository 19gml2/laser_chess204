# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Welcome to the major project for CISC/CMPE 204 (Fall 2021)!

Our project take a 4x5 board for the game laser chess radomly places the piece on the board for the excpetion of the laser and finds out if there is a possibility to win the game by doing 0 or 1 move. The constraints are basiccaly the moves allowed in laser chess and the model will be a sucess if the laser reaches the king.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
